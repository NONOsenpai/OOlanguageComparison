# Reflection

## Java
* Java includes methods for any and all forms of reflection.
<br></br>
Some examples include `instanceof`,`.getDeclaredMethods()`,`.getClass()`,  and A LOT of other methods.
* Allows for  changing values of fields at runtime
* Java defined the standard for reflection in OO- programming languages, all the way back in January of 1998.

* Java was very focused on providing reflection throughout the language. Since Java 7, they even included a package [java.lang.reflect]

## C#
* With C#, you can use reflection to dynamically create an instance of a type, bind the type to an existing object, or get the type from an existing object and invoke its methods or access its fields and properties. If you are using attributes in your code, reflection enables you to access them.
* When you have to access attributes in your program's metadata.
* For examining and instantiating types in an assembly.
* For building new types at runtime. Use classes in System.Reflection.Emit.
* For performing late binding, accessing methods on types created at run time.
