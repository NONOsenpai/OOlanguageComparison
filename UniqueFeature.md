## Python
* While the Python language has evolved over the years by taking in aspects of other languages, it does have a few specific features. First, Python explicitly passes self as a form of a parameter to object member functions. The language also combines things such as data entry - prompting the user for entry and reading it in - to a simple function called 'input()'. Finally, the language incorporates a large number of datatypes such as ordereddict, namedtupke, array, list, tuple, diction, etc; making it popular in the scientific community.
