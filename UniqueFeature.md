# Unique Features

## Java
* Simple

* Secured
* Robust
* Architecture neutral
* Dynamic
* Interpreted
* High Performance
* Multithreaded
* Distributed

## C# 
* Assemblies: This is a level of encapsulation above the typical namespaces or modules in most languages. Assemblies are similar to the idea of static/dynamic libraries in C or JAR files in Java. Notably, you can mark members as internal, which makes them public within the same assembly, but private to everybody outside the assembly. 
* Cross-language compatibility is first-class (not just for C): C# runs in the Common Language Runtime, which was designed from the beginning to support interoperability between languages.
* Properties are first-class: No longer need to write explicit getter and (optional) setter methods.
* Listeners are first-class: Classes can declare an event Foo with addFooListener and removeFooListener functionality built in.
* Foreign Methods are first-class: C# calls these extension methods.
* Partial Classes: Allows a classâ€™s members to be defined in multiple files. Useful to add functionality to a generated class (for example, from a parser generator) without those modifications getting lost when the class is next regenerated.
