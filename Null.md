# Null/Nil references
## C# 
C# utilizes ```null``` (versus Nil or none).  The ```null``` keyword is a literal that represents a null reference, one that does not refer to any object. Null is the default value of reference-type variables. Ordinary value types cannot be null. However, C# 2.0 introduced nullable value types.
```
        string s = null;
```
