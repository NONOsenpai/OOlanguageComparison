# Null/Nil references

## Java
* In Java, a variable is a reference to an object. A null value thus indicates an unset reference (i.e. a reference to nothing). You can see variables as containers(*), inside which you can put an object of a given type, when the variable is null , it means your container is empty.

## C# 
* C# utilizes ```null``` (versus Nil or none).  The ```null``` keyword is a literal that represents a null reference, one that does not refer to any object. Null is the default value of reference-type variables. Ordinary value types cannot be null. However, C# 2.0 introduced nullable value types.
```
        string s = null;
