# Types

## Java
* primitive data tyoes are boolean byte char short int long float double
* Values of class type are references. Strings are references to an instance of class String.
* java do support reference and value types.
* java can create new data types


## Python
* Python accomodates numeric types such as int, long and float. It also includes some built-in data types such as dictionary, list, set, and tuple. The determination of value or reference in Python is difficult as everything is an object in this language. This means that while the language is passed by value, the value is a reference, or pointer, to the specific object. An easier way to look at values and references in Python is to think of them just names, with the mutable or immmutatable being important. If the passed names are mutatable, they can be rebranded to be anything they need. 

* Types in Python can be created or altered. In fact, everything object in Python can be extended to include addictional functions or change the default functions.
