# Functional Programming

## Java
* Java supports "Functional Style Programming" with Lambdas not "Functional Programming". Functional programming is a wholly different paradigm and traditional OOP based programming languages lack functional features in one way or other.


## C# 
* C# includes explicit language extensions to support functional programming, including lambda expressions and type inference. LINQ technology is a form of declarative, functional programming.
