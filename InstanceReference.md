# Instance reference name in data type (class) 

## Java
* In Java we use the 'this' keyword to refer to the current instance of the class.


## Python
* Python uses the 'self' keyword to reference the name of the data type. Python is special in that self doesn't need to be added to the signature as each object recognizes the current instance as 'self'
