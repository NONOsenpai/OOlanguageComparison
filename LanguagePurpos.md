## Java
* Java was started as a project called "Oak" by James Gosling in June 1991. Gosling's goals were to implement a virtual machine and a language that had a familiar C-like notation but with greater uniformity and simplicity than C/C++. 

* Java emphasis on speed

* The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.


## Python
* Python was implemented in late 1989. The language was invented to be a language capable of exception handling and to interact with the Amoeba operation system. In 2000, the Python 2.0 was introduced to include a cycle-detecting garbage collector, support for Unicode, and for a shift to a community-based development process.
* The language was created to replace the language ABC. It has become popular on its own though due its easability in reading, object-orientation, structured programming, functional programming, and ability to be used as a scripting language.
